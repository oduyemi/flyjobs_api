# Pre-School API Documentation
Welcome to the Pre-School API documentation! This API maintains the records of all students in a private Daycare center.

### Powered by Python FastAPI, achieving database independence with SQLAlchemy

The goal is to keep the end-users in mind and aim for a system that not only meets the technical requirements but is also practical and user-friendly for those interacting with it on a daily basis.

### Aim:

#### Data Structure:

To define a clear and organized data structure to store information about each student. Include fields like name, age, parent/guardian contacts, emergency contacts, medical information, and any specific details related to each class.

#### Class Hierarchy:

Implement a class hierarchy. Each class can inherit common attributes and methods from a base class, making it easier to manage and scale the system.

#### Authentication and Authorization:

Implement secure authentication to ensure that only authorized personnel can access and modify student records.

Define user roles based on responsibilities (teachers, administrators, parents) and set up appropriate permissions.

#### Search and Filter Functionality:

Design a robust search and filter system. Users should be able to easily find specific students or groups based on various criteria like class, age, medical conditions, etc.

#### Attendance Tracking:

Include a feature for tracking attendance. This is crucial for keeping records of each student's presence, especially for programs like before and after school care.

#### Feedback Mechanism:

Implement a feedback mechanism for parents and staff. This will help ensure continuous improvement based on real user experiences and needs.
